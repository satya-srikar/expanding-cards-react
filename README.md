# Expanding Cards Application

This is a simple web application built using **React** and **TypeScript**, designed to demonstrate beginner-level HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (now enhanced with React components and TypeScript types). The application allows users to click on an image card, which will expand the selected card while contracting all other cards.

## How It Works

- The page displays five image cards with labels like "Parking Lot", "Traffic," etc.
- When a user clicks on a card, the selected card expands, showing more of the image.
- All other cards automatically contract, ensuring only one card is expanded at any given time.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **HTML & CSS**: Defines the structure and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Adds interactivity for expanding and contracting the image cards.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the project locally with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
5. Click on any card to see the expand/contract functionality in action.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
